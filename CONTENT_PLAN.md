# Content Plan - Chunk 4: Section-by-Section Content Development

## Overall Narrative
"High-value but selective" - Ryan is an extremely capable, analytical, and collaborative problem-solver who prioritizes flexibility, intellectual engagement, and ethical alignment in work.

## Target Audience
Mix of: tech companies/startups, consulting clients, unconventional employers who value diverse backgrounds. Filtering for those who appreciate analytical thinking applied across contexts (data, strategy, Magic).

## Work Approach
Tight AI-human validation loops. For each section:
1. I propose specific content
2. You review and provide feedback
3. I iterate based on feedback
4. You approve before moving to next section
