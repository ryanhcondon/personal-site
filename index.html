                    <p>Hi! I'm Ryan (I use they/them pronouns, but also comfortable with he or she!).</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm currently competing as a professional Magic: The Gathering player with team <a href="https://magic.gg/news/the-week-that-was-building-a-sanctum-for-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sanctum of All</a>, and <a href="https://patreon.com/ryancmtg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing about strategy and decision-making</a> on Patreon. I previously spent four years at <a href="https://qeepsake.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Qeepsake</a> leading growth marketing and later building the company's data infrastructure as a Business Intelligence Architect. Before that I worked at <a href="https://wayfair.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a> for a year as a marketing data analyst. I have a degree in (and passion for!) mathematics from Washington University in St. Louis, with minors in computer science and psychology.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm looking for work in a high-agency, intellectually engaging environment that aligns with my ethics and allows me the flexibility to do deep, thoughtful work.</p>

This includes: Analyzing heaps of data to distill clear + implementable takeaways, vetting better business intelligence software tools, creating process documentation for improving internal systems, helping to recruit new hires, and, most importantly, helping everyone see the forest for the trees by asking questions like, 'is that the most efficient approach to getting the answer?' or 'what's the tradeoff?' Ryan's not afraid to make mistakes, speak their mind, and move quickly--all while deeply valuing and respecting the opinions of their colleagues. Ryan's got the DNA and instinct for stepping up and getting @#$% done on day one."

Ryan is bright, a hard worker, a self-starter, a critical thinker, and they're easy to work with. Before taking on a new task they ensure they have the big picture so they can fine tune their approach based on the project's goals. They will push back when a directive or goal isn't clear enough. Ryan is complaint-free when slogging through the inevitable grunt work that comes with most roles. Ryan uses those opportunities to work on documenting and improving business process so the task can be done faster and more accurately in the future, by them or by someone else."

                                "I don't how much feedback I can give Ryan that will help them meaningfully improve as a teammate. They are one of the best I have ever worked with. They lead by example, practice what they preach, and their beliefs are usually based on specific testable claims and when those claims are falsified, they react logically. They are calm and at peace when everyone is stressed. They run a good meeting. They set clear, reasonable and effective policies that help people learn effectively. I almost want to tell them to be more aggressive about what they think because it's so great, but their current style seems very effective in practice."
