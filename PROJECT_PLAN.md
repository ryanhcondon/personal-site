# Personal Portfolio Website - Project Plan

## Overview
Create a clean, professional personal portfolio website with sections for work history, skills, and links. Deploy it to the internet using free hosting (Vercel or Netlify).

## Tech Stack
- **Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Simple, fast, easy to customize
- **Responsive design** - Works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Free hosting** - Deploy to Vercel or Netlify with a single command

## Site Structure

We'll create a single-page site with these sections:
- **Header/Hero** - Your name and tagline
- **About** - Bio section where you can explain your background and recent work (like professional Magic: The Gathering)
- **Experience** - Work history with flexible formatting for non-traditional experiences
- **Skills** - Technical and other relevant skills
- **Links** - Patreon, social media, etc.
- **Contact** - Email or contact information

## Implementation Plan

### Files to Create
1. **index.html** - Main HTML structure with semantic sections
2. **styles.css** - Clean, professional styling with:
   - Modern typography
   - Subtle animations/transitions
   - Responsive breakpoints for mobile
   - Professional color scheme (easily customizable)
3. **script.js** (if needed) - Minimal JavaScript for smooth scrolling or interactions
4. **README.md** - Instructions for updating content and deploying

### Deployment
- Set up with Vercel or Netlify (both offer free hosting)
- Simple deployment via their CLI or GitHub integration
- Provide you with a live URL you can share

## Customization
The site will be structured so you can easily:
- Update text content by editing HTML
- Change colors/fonts by modifying CSS variables
- Add images by placing them in an `images/` folder
- Update anytime and redeploy in seconds

## Timeline Estimate
- Building the website: ~2-4 hours
- Deployment setup: ~30 minutes - 1 hour
- Content creation: Variable (depends on you)

## Next Steps
1. Discuss workflow and communication preferences
2. Begin implementation when ready
3. Iterate based on feedback
4. Deploy to live URL
