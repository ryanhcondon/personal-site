# Personal Portfolio Website - Project Plan

## Overview
Create a clean, professional personal portfolio website with sections for work history, skills, and links. Deploy it to the internet using free hosting (Vercel or Netlify).

## Tech Stack
- **Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Simple, fast, easy to customize
- **Responsive design** - Works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Free hosting** - Deploy to Vercel or Netlify with a single command

## Site Structure

We'll create a single-page site with these sections:
- **Header/Hero** - Your name and tagline
- **About** - Bio section where you can explain your background and recent work (like professional Magic: The Gathering)
- **Experience** - Work history with flexible formatting for non-traditional experiences
- **Skills** - Technical and other relevant skills
- **Links** - Patreon, social media, etc.
- **Contact** - Email or contact information

## Implementation Plan - Foundation First Approach

### Chunk 1: HTML Structure + CSS Foundation
**Goal:** "I have a website that looks professional"
- Basic HTML5 structure with all sections (header, about, experience, skills, links)
- CSS setup: color scheme, typography, spacing system
- Basic layout structure
- Placeholder/minimal text in sections

**Validation:** Open in browser, looks clean and organized even with placeholder content

### Chunk 2: Responsive Design
**Goal:** "It looks good on my phone too"
- Add media queries for tablet and mobile
- Test on different screen widths
- Adjust spacing/layout for small screens

**Validation:** Resize browser window, check on phone if possible

### Chunk 3: Deployment
**Goal:** "I can share the URL"
- Set up Vercel or Netlify (free hosting)
- Deploy to live URL
- Test live site
- Create simple README with update instructions

**Validation:** Live URL works, all assets load correctly

### Chunk 4: Content Refinement + Links
**Goal:** "My real information is in there and functional"
- Replace placeholders with your actual content
- Add working external links (Patreon, social media)
- Add any images if you have them
- Fine-tune any styling based on real content length

**Validation:** Read through as if showing to someone, test all links

### Files to Create
1. **index.html** - Main HTML structure with semantic sections
2. **styles.css** - Clean, professional styling with:
   - Modern typography
   - Subtle animations/transitions
   - Responsive breakpoints for mobile
   - Professional color scheme (easily customizable)
3. **script.js** (if needed) - Minimal JavaScript for smooth scrolling or interactions
4. **README.md** - Instructions for updating content and redeploying

## Customization
The site will be structured so you can easily:
- Update text content by editing HTML
- Change colors/fonts by modifying CSS variables
- Add images by placing them in an `images/` folder
- Update anytime and redeploy in seconds

## Timeline Estimate
- Building the website: ~2-4 hours
- Deployment setup: ~30 minutes - 1 hour
- Content creation: Variable (depends on you)

## Next Steps
1. Discuss workflow and communication preferences
2. Begin implementation when ready
3. Iterate based on feedback
4. Deploy to live URL
