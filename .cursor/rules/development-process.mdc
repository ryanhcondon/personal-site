# Development Process & Best Practices

## Git Workflow (Lightweight)

### Approach
- **Work on main branch** - no need for feature branches (solo project)
- Use git primarily for **version history** and deployment
- Commit at logical milestones when you're happy with progress
- Keep it simple and casual - git as a tool, not a gate

### When to Commit
- After completing a section that works well
- Before making risky changes (easy rollback point)
- At the end of a work session
- When you want to save a "checkpoint" you might return to
- **Not required** to gate every chunk - commit when it feels natural

### Good Commit Points
- "Initial HTML structure and basic styling"
- "Add About and Experience sections"
- "Responsive design improvements"
- "Ready for deployment"

### Commit Best Practices
- Write clear commit messages describing what changed
- Stage files selectively (`git add specific-file.css`)
- Test in browser before committing (make sure it looks good)
- Use `git status` and `git diff` to review what you're committing

## Chunk-Based Development

Break the website into independently testable sections:

### Standard Chunk Pattern
1. **Plan**: Define clear scope for the section (e.g., "About section with bio text")
2. **Implement**: Write HTML/CSS/JS for the section
3. **AI Validation**: 
   - Check code syntax
   - Verify files were created/updated
   - Basic structure checks
4. **Human Validation**: 
   - Open in browser and review visual appearance
   - Check on different screen widths (desktop, tablet, mobile)
   - Test any interactive elements
   - Verify content displays correctly
5. **Iterate if needed**: Fix issues found during validation
6. **Move forward**: Proceed to next chunk after approval
7. **Commit when natural**: Save checkpoints at logical milestones (not required after every chunk)

### Example (Website Build)
- **Chunk 1**: Basic HTML structure and header → test in browser
- **Chunk 2**: About section with styling → test appearance
- **Chunk 3**: Experience section → test layout
- **Chunk 4**: Links and contact section → test functionality
- **Chunk 5**: Responsive design refinements → test on mobile
- **Chunk 6**: Deployment configuration → test live URL

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Validation
For web development, primary testing is visual:
- **Open in browser**: Use browser preview or local file
- **Screen sizes**: Test desktop (1920px), tablet (768px), mobile (375px)
- **Cross-browser** (if time permits): Chrome, Safari, Firefox
- **Interactive elements**: Click links, test any JavaScript

### Manual Checks
- **Content accuracy**: Text displays as intended
- **Images**: Load correctly, appropriate sizes
- **Links**: External links work, open in correct tab
- **Layout**: Sections aligned properly, no overflow issues
- **Typography**: Readable fonts, appropriate sizes
- **Colors**: Professional appearance, good contrast

### Basic Functionality Testing
Before committing, verify:
- All internal navigation works
- External links point to correct URLs
- Images load (no broken image icons)
- Page displays without JavaScript errors (check console)

## Code Organization

### File Structure
```
/
├── index.html          # Main page
├── styles.css          # All styles
├── script.js           # JavaScript (if needed)
├── images/             # Image assets
│   └── ...
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/          # Project guidelines
├── PROJECT_PLAN.md     # High-level plan
└── README.md           # Deployment and update instructions
```

### HTML Best Practices
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, etc.)
- Add appropriate ARIA labels for accessibility
- Keep structure clean and commented

### CSS Best Practices
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for colors, fonts, spacing
- Mobile-first approach (base styles for mobile, media queries for desktop)
- Comment major sections
- Keep specificity low (avoid unnecessary nesting)

### JavaScript Best Practices
- Keep minimal - only add if needed for real functionality
- Progressive enhancement (site works without JS)
- Clean, commented code

## Deployment

### Preparation
- Verify all paths are relative (not absolute local paths)
- Test final version locally
- Check for any console errors
- Validate HTML/CSS if desired

### Hosting Options
- **Vercel**: Simple CLI deployment
- **Netlify**: Drag-and-drop or CLI
- **GitHub Pages**: Git-based deployment

### After Deployment
- Test live URL thoroughly
- Verify all assets load correctly
- Check on mobile device (real device, not just DevTools)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Not testing in browser** before moving forward
2. **Breaking existing sections** when adding new ones
3. **Using absolute file paths** that won't work when deployed
4. **Not testing mobile responsiveness** until the end
5. **Overly complex code** when simple HTML/CSS would suffice
6. **Forgetting to commit** at good checkpoint moments

## When Agent Should Warn

The AI assistant should proactively flag:
- Making significant technical choices (hosting, deployment, architecture, tools) without discussing options
- Complex JavaScript when simple HTML/CSS would work
- Skipping visual validation before approval
- Non-responsive design (mobile not considered)
- Accessibility issues (missing alt text, poor contrast, etc.)
- File paths that won't work when deployed
- Making too many changes without a checkpoint commit (suggest committing)
